# Motivational Quote List Maker

Link to project page: https://cynicalcatt.github.io/motivation-quote-list/

Completed list maker for a course I'm currently undertaking. Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery).

Originally was a task list, but I thought there were enough of those out there. So I changed the color scheme and a couple of other things to change it into something that would brighten up someone's day.

**Note:** I plan on implementing some additional features as my skills get better. Some of my ideas include:
- Ability to "save" list so you can come back and see what you wrote before
- Quote at the bottom changes to another random motivational quote every refresh
- Side links to guides on how to motivate yourself
